                <h2>Dropping Biscuits: I got the hook on Music.</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2> I created Dropping Biscuits because of my love for Music and Pop Culture.</h2>
            <h3> As I have gotten older, I have started to see a direct connection to the music I listen to and sports and activities I enjoy. For instance, I was watching a NBA game the other day and after the game went to quarter, the first commercial following the break in play was a NBA sponsored advertisement for this years playoff season and the background music behind the montage of plays and Famous NBA players was a song by a coming rapper named J.I.D who I have been trying to get my friends and family to listen to for years. And that's just the tip of the Iceberg...</h3>
              <br>
            <h3> Along those same lines, I keep finding myself in situations where I am introducing people to new music or I am the one who connects the dots on a lyric, reference or interpretation that was either unclear or too advanced for them to understand. That being said, I felt like I could use my style and knowledge of music to showcase and introduce people to new style/people they have never heard of or know nothing about. </h3>
            <h3> (Current focus: R&B, Hip-Hop and and new age funk/soul (Denzel Curry, Smino and Mac Miller(RIP)) </h3>
                <br>
                <br>
            <h3> Every week or so I will highlight and showcase a Band/Artist or Collective I feel desrcves more appriciation and streams. Just like I mentioned Earlier, I have been able to find, adore and religously listen to bands and artists long before they become mainstream and popluar. And, because I have found numerous bands/acts on numerous occasions, I feel the need to educatee and bless people with great music and people slighty before they become household names. </h3>
